East Tusom is a Tangkhulic (Tibeto-Burman) language of Manipur State, India. It is highly endangered and is spoken primarily in one village in Ukhrul distinct. It has areally unsual phonetics and phonology. David and collaborators are currently working to document East Tusom and to build speech resources based upon field recordings of the language.

A speech dataset from Tusom (called [Tusom2021](https://www.github.com/dmort27/tusom2021)) is available on GitHub. A [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00824) of the paper describing this dataset is available on arXiv. This paper has been accepted for Interspeech 2021.
